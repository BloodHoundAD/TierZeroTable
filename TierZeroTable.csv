Note: By default, this built-in group has no members. The group can create and manage users and groups in the domain, including its own membership and that of the Server Operators group. This group is considered a service administrator group because it can modify Server Operators, which in turn can modify domain controller settings. As a best practice, leave the membership of this group empty, and don't use it for any delegated administration.

That means all objects of these types will be under full control of Account Operators unless they are protected with AdminSDHolder. Not all Tier Zero objects will be protected with AdminSDHolder typically, as not all Tier Zero objects will be included in Protected Accounts and Groups. This means Account Operators members have a path to compromise Tier Zero most often.

It is possible to delete all GenricAll ACEs for Account Operators on Tier Zero objects. To protect future Tier Zero objects, one would have to either remove the Account Operators ACE from the default security descriptors or implement a process of removing the ACEs as Tier Zero objects are being created.

Members of the following groups can modify Backup Operators group membership: default service Administrators, Domain Admins in the domain, and Enterprise Admins. Members of the Backup Operators group can't modify the membership of any administrative groups. Although members of this group can't change server settings or modify the configuration of the directory, they do have the permissions needed to replace files (including operating system files) on domain controllers.

Because you can delegate administration of an RODC to a domain user or security group, an RODC is well suited for a site that shouldn't have a user who is a member of the Domain Admins group. An RODC has the following functionality:

Contains read-only AD DS database
